#### Choose any Distributed Database/Technology. It can be what we discussed in class or anything of your choice.

Definitely not a RDBMS (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, Teradata, ProstreSQL and so on...). If in doubt email me and get clarified before you start the work.

#### Choose a authentic Public Dataset containing at least 100,000 rows (99,999 is okay) and 8 columns. If its JSON it should contain similar datasize.

#### Dataset can be JSON, CSV, Parquet, Avro anything your like to use or supported by your database.

#### Import the data into your database.

Using Visualization tools like Tableau or Power Bi query the data and create 3  Visualizations. Quality of work should be what you would like to present to your future employer during the interview.
If you are not into Visualization then build 3 ML models.
or combination of Viz & Models (should add upto 3)

Using Screen recorder, walk through the input data, how you imported it, what tool you used and explain the visualization or model. Total video should not be more than 6 minutes and upload it to Youtube. (No need to record your face, just audio is enough)
