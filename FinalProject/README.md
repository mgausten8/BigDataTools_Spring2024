#### NOMINATE Scores

In political data analysis, Nominate scores, also known as NOMINATE (NOMINAl Three-step Estimation) scores, are a method used to estimate the ideological positions of legislators based on their voting behavior. These scores provide a quantitative measure of a legislator's political ideology along one or more dimensions.

Dimension 1 (D1): Dimension 1 of Nominate scores typically represents the left-right ideological spectrum or the economic dimension. A higher score on Dimension 1 indicates a more conservative or right-leaning position, while a lower score indicates a more liberal or left-leaning position. Legislators with similar Dimension 1 scores are considered to have similar ideological positions on economic issues.
Dimension 2 (D2): Dimension 2 of Nominate scores often represents the social or cultural dimension. It captures ideological differences that may not be fully captured by Dimension 1. A higher score on Dimension 2 may indicate a more socially conservative position, while a lower score may indicate a more socially liberal position. Legislators with similar Dimension 2 scores are considered to have similar ideological positions on social issues.
Nominate scores are typically calculated using roll call voting data, where legislators' votes on various bills are analyzed to determine patterns of agreement and disagreement. By estimating these scores, political scientists can quantitatively analyze ideological trends, party polarization, coalition formation, and legislative behavior over time.

Nominate scores have been widely used in political science research to study legislative behavior, party dynamics, and the ideological composition of political institutions. They provide valuable insights into the ideological positions of legislators and the dynamics of policymaking in representative democracies.

## Final Project

#### Choose any Distributed Database/Technology. It can be what we discussed in class or anything of your choice.
Example: Redis, Neo4J, MongoDB, Spark, ELK..

Definitely not a RDBMS (SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, Teradata, ProstreSQL and so on...). If in doubt email me and get clarified before you start the work.

#### Choose a authentic Public Dataset containing at least 100,000 rows (99,999 is okay) and 8 columns. If its JSON it should contain similar datasize.

#### Dataset can be JSON, CSV, Parquet, Avro anything your like to use or supported by your database.

#### Import the data into your database.

Using Visualization tools like Tableau or Power Bi query the data and create 3  Visualizations. Quality of work should be what you would like to present to your future employer during the interview.
If you are not into Visualization then build 3 ML models.
or combination of Viz & Models (should add upto 3)
Submit the following

Using Screen recorder, walk through the input data, how you imported it, what tool you used and explain the visualization or model. Total video should not be more than 6 minutes and upload it to Youtube. (No need to record your face, just audio is enough)
Also mention what you liked/didn't link in this course.
#### Push your project to Github Repo and share the URL.

#### UNLISTED Youtube URL of the video. (No Google Drives/Shares). Only YouTube.
